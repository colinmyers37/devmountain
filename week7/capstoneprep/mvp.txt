The basic idea of my website will be a site to calculate your handicap in golf.
I will take slope rating of the golf course and multiply it by your adjusted gross score - the course rating - the pcc adjustment.
In this site you will be able to your score from your previous 3 rounds in order to calculate your handicap.
I will use a post request in order to display the results of the handicap and a put and delete request to update the results or delete the results.
